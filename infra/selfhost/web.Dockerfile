# Separate from `infra/docker/node-app.Dockerfile` because the two builds have
# nothing in common past the install: the backend services are `tsc --build`
# output started with `node dist/main.js`, and this is a Next.js application
# with its own compiler, its own output layout and its own server.
#
# The build context is the repository ROOT, same as the backend image and for
# the same reason: these are pnpm workspace packages whose dependencies resolve
# through the root lockfile.

# Pinned to the patch, like the backend image: `24.x` would let the runtime
# drift away from the version the lockfile was resolved against.

# THE THREE PUBLIC URLS ARE COMPILED IN — SO THIS BUILDS AGAINST PLACEHOLDERS.
#
# Next.js inlines every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value into the browser bundle at build
# time. The dashboard's calls to the api, the SSE stream and the collector are
# made by the visitor's browser, so those three origins end up inside the
# compiled output rather than being read from the container's environment.
#
# That is workable for an image you build on your own host and impossible for
# one that is PUBLISHED: an image built with our hostnames would send every
# other install's dashboard to our servers. Since v0.1.0 this repository
# publishes these images to a registry, so the build uses three reserved
# sentinel origins under `.invalid`, stashes the handful of built files that
# contain them, and `apps/web/docker-entrypoint.sh` substitutes the real values
# from the environment at container start.
#
# The sentinels are duplicated in that script. They have to agree: the stash
# below is keyed on finding them, and the entrypoint refuses to start if one
# survives substitution — which is what catches a change made in only one place.
